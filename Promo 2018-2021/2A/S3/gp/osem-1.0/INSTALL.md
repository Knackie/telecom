# Install Open Source Event Manager
OSEM is a *Ruby on Rails* application. We recommend to run OSEM in production with [mod_passenger](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/download/#open_source)
and the [apache web-server](https://www.apache.org/). There are tons of guides on how to deploy rails apps on various
base operating systems. [Check Google](https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&q=ruby%20on%20rails%20apache%20passenger) ;-)

For more information about rails and what it can do, see the [rails guides.](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)

## Dependencies

### ImageMagick
We use [ImageMagick](http://imagemagick.org/) for image manipulation so it needs to be available in your installation.
If you would like to resize exisiting logos in your OSEM installation you can do so by running the following rake task:

```shell
$ bundle exec rake logo:reprocess
```

### openID
In order to use [openID](http://openid.net/) logins for your OSEM installation you need to register your application with the providers ([Google](https://code.google.com/apis/console#:access), [GitHub](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) or [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/)) and enter their API keys in `config/secrets.yml` file, changing the existing sample values.

## Recurring Jobs
=======
Open a separate terminal and go into the directory where the rails app is present, and type the following to start the delayed_jobs worker for sending email notifications.
```
bundle exec rake jobs:work
```
